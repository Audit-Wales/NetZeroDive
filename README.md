# DIVE (Directed Interactive Video/Visualisation Experience)

DIVE is a framework for creating "Interruptible Narrative Visualizations (INV)." It bridges the gap between curated, author-driven data stories (like videos) and user-driven exploratory tools (like interactive dashboards).

## Core Concept

- **Watch Mode:** An automated narrative plays, panning, zooming, and highlighting data to tell a specific story.
- **Explore Mode:** Users can pause the narrative at any time to freely interact with and explore the underlying data using the native visualization tool's capabilities.
- **Resume Handoff:** Resuming playback instantly snaps the visualization back to the curated narrative path, continuing the story seamlessly.

## Architecture Overview

- **Library Agnostic:** Uses an Adapter Pattern to integrate with any interactive library (e.g., D3.js, Apache ECharts, Mapbox).
- **Web Component:** Delivered as a Custom Web Element (`<dive-video>`) for simple integration and encapsulation.
- **State Management:** A Sequencer and Virtual State Cache maintain perfect synchronization between the narrative timeline and the interactive chart.

For full technical details, see the [DIVE Framework Specification](DIVE-framework-spec.md).

## Install

```bash
npm install dive-video
```

The package name is `dive-video` because `dive` is already taken on npm. Importing the module registers the `<dive-video>` custom element.

```js
import 'dive-video';
```

Or import the public API:

```js
import { registerTool } from 'dive-video';
```

## CDN

After a version is published to npm, jsDelivr and unpkg serve it automatically:

Live demo (GitHub Pages): https://adamridley.github.io/DIVE/

The demo loads `dive-video` from jsDelivr and plays a same-origin `wealth.dive` pack.

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dive-video@1.2.1/dist/dive.js"></script>
<dive-video src="./wealth.dive"></dive-video>
```

Classic (non-module) script tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dive-video@1.0.0/dist/dive.iife.js"></script>
<dive-video src="./story.json"></dive-video>
```

The IIFE build exposes `window.DIVE` (`DiveVideo`, `registerTool`, `Sequencer`).

Story JSON can include `aspectRatio` (default `9:16`), `audio` (URL or clip objects), and `captions` (WebVTT URL or `{ startTime, endTime, text }` cues). If you only set the element's width, it sizes its height from the aspect ratio and letterboxes when the box is forced (explicit height or fullscreen).

## Local development

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

- PoC: http://localhost:5173/
- Wealth and Health example: http://localhost:5173/examples/the_wealth_and_health_of_nations/

```bash
npm run test:ci          # typecheck + library build + dist smoke check
npm run build            # ESM + IIFE + typings → dist/
npm run build:example    # example site → dist-example/
```

## CI/CD

This repository now includes two GitHub Actions workflows:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Runs on pull requests and pushes to `main`.
- Installs dependencies with `npm ci`.
- Runs `npm run test:ci` (typecheck + production build).
- Performs a Docker smoke build for `examples/the_wealth_and_health_of_nations/Dockerfile`.

- `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
- Runs on pushes to `main` and on manual dispatch.
- Packs `wealth.dive` and deploys a static demo to GitHub Pages (CDN player + same-origin pack).

- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Runs on tags matching `v*.*.*` and on manual dispatch.
- Builds the library (`dist/dive.js`, `dist/dive.iife.js`) and publishes it to npm as `dive-video`.
- Publishes release artifacts (`dist.tar.gz`, `dist-example.tar.gz`) to GitHub Releases.
- Builds and pushes the example Docker image.

Uses npm trusted publishing (OIDC) from this workflow. No `NPM_TOKEN` secret. The trusted publisher on npm must allow `release.yml` in `AdamRidley/DIVE`.

### Release image registry settings

By default, the release workflow pushes to `ghcr.io`.

To push to a custom/private registry, configure these GitHub repository settings:

- Variables: `DOCKER_REGISTRY`, `DOCKER_IMAGE_REPO` (example: `dive-example` or `myorg/dive-example`, must be lowercase)
- Secrets: `DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`

### Triggering a release

Create and push a semantic version tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
